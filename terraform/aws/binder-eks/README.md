# BinderHub on AWS EKS

This module deploys an AWS EKS cluster with IRSA roles to support BinderHub ECR access.

The module has optional support for using a limited non-administrative AWS role with a permissions boundary to deploy the cluster.

For an example see [curvenote](../curvenote/README.md)
